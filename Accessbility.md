## Marketing

Our recipe application is designed for food enthusiasts of all skill levels who value convenience and personalization 
in meal preparation. This includes individuals looking for healthier meal options by filtering recipes based on calorie 
counts, or those with specific dietary preferences like vegetarian or gluten-free options. Families or groups can easily
find diverse recipes to accommodate varied tastes and dietary needs, fostering a shared cooking experience. Additionally, 
the program is particularly appealing to users who enjoy contributing and engaging with a community by sharing personal
recipes or leaving reviews for others.

## Accessibility Discussion

Certain demographics, such as individuals with visual impairments or mobility challenges, may find traditional recipe 
applications less accessible unless specific accommodations are made. As emphasized in the embedded ethics modules, 
failing to design for users with disabilities can cause both tangible harms and social inequality. 
Features like text-to-speech for visually impaired users or voice commands for individuals with limited mobility could 
bridge this gap. Incorporating principles of universal design, such as intuitive navigation and adjustable text sizes, 
would ensure that the program is inclusive and usable by a broader audience
